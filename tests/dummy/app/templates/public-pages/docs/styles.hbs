<h1 class="doc-page-title">Styles</h1>

<p>
  Since this component doesn't any visual theme, you can apply styles to it just with plain
  CSS or even adding the classes your favourite CSS framework gives you.
</p>

<p>
  If don't use any css pre-processor this is all. If you do use SASS or LESS, the addon
  will know it and will have to <code>@import</code> the styles explicitly. This gives you
  the chance to set a few variables that Ember Basic Dropdown will use.
</p>

<p>
  There is only four variables you can tweak (Sass syntax)
</p>

<CodeSnippet @name="styles-1.scss"/>

<p>
  If by example you want to change the colour of the overlay to be blue, you could do this
  in your <code>app.scss</code>/<code>app.less</code>.
</p>

<CodeSnippet @name="styles-2.scss"/>

<p>
  In the next sections we'll give in more involved customizations.
