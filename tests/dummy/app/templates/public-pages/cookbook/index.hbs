<p>
  Ember Basic Dropdown can take a fair amount of configuration options on
  invocations to alter its default behavior.
</p>

<p>
  If you want all your dropdowns to behave on a certain way or have some certain classes?
  Repeating the same options over and over on your templates is boring.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to apply a configuration option to all your dropdowns there is no special way
  or key in the <code>/config/environment.js</code> you need to learn.
  Just use The Ember Wayâ„¢.
</p>

<p>
  Inside your app's <code>/app/components</code> folder create a <code>ember-basic-dropdown.js</code>
  file:
</p>

<CodeSnippet @name="system-wide-config-1-js.js"/>

<p>
  That's all. No new concepts to learn, just your usual ember-cli work flow.
</p>

<p>
  In this example the component is also named <code>\{{basic-dropdown}}</code> but using this approach
  you can create many components with different names that extend and customize the default one without
  modifying it.
