<h1 class='doc-page-title'>Addons</h1>

<p>
  This component is pretty low lever and is intended to be a building block to
  build your own components on top.
</p>

<p>
  If you build something reusable that you think it's worth sharing you can
  publish it as an addon so other can use it.
</p>

<p>If so, let me know and I'll add it to this section. You can use the one below
  as inspiration.</p>
