<h1 class='doc-page-title'>System-wide config</h1>

<p>
  Ember Basic Dropdown can take a fair amount of configuration options on
  invocations to alter its default behavior.
</p>

<p>
  If you want all your dropdowns to behave on a certain way or have some certain
  classes? Repeating the same options over and over on your templates is boring.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to apply a configuration option to all your dropdowns there is no
  special way or key in the
  <code>/config/environment.js</code>
  you need to learn. Just use The Ember Way™.
</p>

<p>
  Inside your app's
  <code>/app/components</code>
  folder create a
  <code>ember-basic-dropdown.js</code>
  file:
</p>

{{get-code-snippet "system-wide-config-1-js.js" }}

<p>
  That's all. No new concepts to learn, just your usual ember-cli work flow.
</p>

<p>
  In this example the component is also named
  <code>\{{basic-dropdown}}</code>
  but using this approach you can create many components with different names
  that extend and customize the default one without modifying it.
